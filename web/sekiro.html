                        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                        <br />Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.
                        <br />[1][2][3][4] Compared to FromSoftware's Souls series, the game features fewer role-playing elements, lacking character creation and the ability to level up a variety of stats, as well as having no multiplayer elements.
                        <br />[3][4][5][6] It does, however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization.
                        <br />Rather than attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, combat in Sekiro revolves around using a katana to attack their posture and balance instead, which eventually leads to an opening that allows for a single killing blow.
                        <br />[3][7] The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to immediately eliminate some enemies if they can get in range undetected.
                        <br />[3] In addition, the player character has the ability to use various tools to assist with combat and exploration, such as a grappling hook.
                        <br />[3] If the player character dies, they have the option of being revived on the spot if they have resurrection power, which is restored over time and by defeating enemies, instead of respawning at earlier checkpoints

                <h3>Development</h3>
                Development of Sekiro began in late 2015, following the completion of Bloodborne's downloadable content, The Old Hunters.
                <br />[10] The game was revealed via a teaser trailer at The Game Awards 2017 in December, showing the tagline "Shadows Die Twice".
                <br />[11] The game's full title was revealed to be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice during the Microsoft press conference at E3 2018.
                <br /> It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki of the Japanese development studio FromSoftware, best known for creating the Souls series and Bloodborne.
                <br />[12] The game was published by Activision worldwide, with FromSoftware self-publishing it in Japan, and Cube Game publishing in the Asia-Pacific region.
                <br />[13][14] Sekiro's soundtrack was composed by Yuka Kitamura,[15] with some contributions from Noriyuki Asakura.
                <br />[16] The game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 22 March 2019.
                <br />[17] A collectors edition of the game was also released the same day, and included a steelbook case, a figurine of the protagonist, an art book, a physical map of the game's world, a download code for the soundtrack, and in-game coin replicas.[17]

                Sekiro draws inspiration from the Tenchu series of stealth-action games that were partially developed and published by FromSoftware.[18] The team initially considered developing the game as a sequel to Tenchu, but as that series had already been shaped by several different studios before they obtained the rights to it, they instead opted to take the project in a different direction.[10] Miyazaki intended for the combat changes to capture the feel of "swords clashing", with fighters trying to create an opening to deliver the fatal strike.[3] He and the team also created the game to be a fully single-player experience, as they believed multiplayer to have limitations they wanted to avoid.[6] The word "Sekiro" means "one-armed wolf" in Japanese, while the subtitle "Shadows Die Twice" was originally only meant to be used as a slogan for the teaser trailer until Activision requested it to be kept for the final name.[3][19] Despite the game taking place during the Sengoku period of real world Japanese history, there are no real historical people or locations featured in the game.[
