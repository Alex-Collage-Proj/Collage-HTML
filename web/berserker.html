                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    The story follows Guts as the "Black Swordsman", an appearance which was briefly seen in the first episode of the 1997 television series as well as in the final scene of the Golden Age Arc films.[7]<br /><br />

                    Guts was once a wandering mercenary taken in by the mercenary group known as the Band of the Hawk (鷹の団 Taka no Dan) and he fought alongside them before their mutilated leader, Griffith, sacrificed his followers to become one of the God Hand and continue his dream of ruling a kingdom of his own. Only Guts and his lover Casca, who lost her sanity and memory from the horrors she saw and endured, escaped the "Eclipse" ritual, though they were branded with marks that attract evil, restless spirits and other similar entities. With Casca in the care of blacksmith Godo and his adopted daughter Erica as well as Rickert, the only member of the Hawks absent during the Eclipse, Guts set off to hunt down the God Hand's Apostles to find and kill Griffith in a quest for vengeance. Years have passed, and Guts is joined in his hunt by an elf named Puck as events the God Hand have long waited for are beginning to unfold.

                <h3>Production</h3>
                <p>
                    A new Berserk anime was announced in December 2015 in Hakusensha's Young Animal magazine,[7][12] with a short preview trailer released at Comiket later the same month.[1][13] The anime's website announced in February 2016 that the project would be a television series.[14] A second trailer was streamed in March 2016.[15][16] A teaser video was streamed on the series' website in early June 2016.[11] At the conclusion of the first season's final episode, a teaser confirmed a second season for April 2017. The brief clip showed off the character Schierke and the Berserker armor, indicating the second season would adapt the next arc, "Hawk of the Millennium Empire".[17]<br /><br />

                    Kentaro Miura, the author of the original manga, served as executive supervisor for the anime.[18] The series is directed by Shin Itagaki, and written by Makoto Fukami and Takashi Yamashita, with character designs provided by Hisashi Abe. Animation studio Liden Films is producing the series with GEMBA and Millepensee helming on the animation production.[2][9] Shirō Sagisu returns from the Berserk: The Golden Age Arc films to compose the music for the series, while Susumu Hirasawa, composer for the 1997 series and the Golden Age Arc films, returns to produce two insert songs for the series, titled "Ashes" (灰よ Hai yo) and "Ash Crow".[9][15][19] For first season, the opening theme song, "Inferno", is performed by 9mm Parabellum Bullet,[15][20] while the ending theme, "Meimoku no Kanata" (瞑目の彼方, lit. "Beyond Closed Eyes"), is performed by Nagi Yanagi.[21] For second season, the opening theme song, "Sacrifice", performed by 9mm Parabellum Bullet, while the ending theme, "Issai wa Monogatari" (一切は物語, lit. "Everything is the Story"), performed by Yoshino Nanjō featuring Nagi Yanagi.[22]<br /><br />

                    The primary voice cast are reprising their roles from the Golden Age Arc film trilogy, while voice actor Unshō Ishizuka is reprising his role as the Narrator from the original anime.[2]<br /><br />

                    Producer Reo Kurosu has described the show's animation style as "a hybrid between 2D and 3D",[23] elaborating that "For this series we’re trying to do something new. The director is a 2D animator so what goes on in his mind and what he puts on storyboard is all in 2D. From there it’s all about choosing which tool to use between full CG animation, traditional 2D, or a hybrid of the two. The director and the 2D and 3D studios will meet and discuss what to use when depending upon what we’re trying to accomplish with each scene."[24] The 3D characters and objects are rendered with Cel shading to make them look more like 2D animation. A particular feature is that the shadows on 3D objects contain a linear hatching effect which simulates shading with a pen or pencil, and the same hatching effect is applied to the shadows that appear on any 2D models to create a more uniform look.<br /><br />
