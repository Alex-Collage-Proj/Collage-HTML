                        <h3>GamePlay</h3>
                        Tekken 7 focuses on 1v1 battles.[3] Two mechanisms are introduced in the game.
                        <br />The first, Rage Art, allows the player to execute critical attacks that deal roughly 30% damage depending on the character once their health bar is critical, in exchange for inactivating the normal attack power increase.
                        <br />The second, Power Crush, lets the player continue their attacks even while being hit by the enemy, although they would still receive the damage dealt by the enemy's attacks.
                        <br />The mechanic also works for absorbing high and mid attacks.
                        <br />[4] The bound system, which staggers a character to increase opportunity for additional hits, is replaced by Screw Attack, which makes the enemy spin sideways when they are hit airborne, allowing the player to inflict additional hits after they reach the ground.
                        <br />Unlike bound, however, Screw Attack cannot be used to do wall combos.
                        <br />With a new display system, the game's multiplayer allows players to choose which side of the screen to play on.
                        <br />[5] Movement has undergone some changes and is similar to the movement mechanics found in Tekken Revolution, most notably when characters walk backwards.
                        <br />The arcade version features the traditional stage-based playthrough, in which the player progresses by beating five different opponents one by one, ending with a fixed penultimate and final stage.
                        <br />Matches may be interrupted if another player joins the game.
                        <br />Online mode is available for both local and international play.
                        <br />Character customization is featured, allowing the player to modify characters' appearances.
                        <br />[6] For the first time in the arcade series, the game features a practice mode, which allows players to train moves against an opponent for a limited amount of time, as well as an option to collect in-game rewards, mainly customization items, through "Treasure Box" by winning enough matches.
                        <br />Fated Retribution features several gameplay changes to the game.
                        <br />The new "Rage Drive" allows the player to empower certain attacks by sacrificing their Rage Mode.
                        <br />Rage Art is also adjusted so that the amount of damage dealt to the enemy is inversely proportional to the player's current health bar.
                        <br />The update introduces meter-type characters, who utilize jump-in attacks and special cancels, and use an EX/Super meter as a limiter for some special attacks in place of Rage Drive. However, they have no 10-hit combo moves.
                        <br />This type is reserved for three characters: Eliza, and the guest characters Akuma from Street Fighter, and Geese Howard from the SNK fighting game series.
                        <br />Meanwhile, Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy XV incorporates both aspects of preexisting gameplay types (he has Tekken-type gameplay but possesses jump-in moves).
                        <br />The update also added Wall Bound, which initially only applied to guest character Geese Howard.
                        <br />The Season 2 update eventually added the mechanic for every character.
                        <br />[7]Further game modes were released as post-release downloadable content (DLC), such as Tekken Bowl, a bowling minigame which first debuted in Tekken Tag Tournament.[8]

                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    After the events of Tekken 6, though Azazel was destroyed by Jin Kazama, the war between the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation continues to ravage the world.
                    <br />The game's story is told from the perspective of a reporter whose wife and son are killed in the crossfire, leading him to begin writing an exposé on the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation.
                    <br />Nina Williams leads the Zaibatsu in Jin's absence, attempting to locate him, but Heihachi Mishima takes advantage of the vacuum of power and forces Nina to work for him, regaining control of the Zaibatsu.
                    <br />Heihachi makes a deal with Claudio Serafino, head of the powerful Sirius Marksmen organization, to help him expose his son, G Corporation head Kazuya Mishima, believing public opinion will shift in the Zaibatsu's favor if Kazuya's Devil Gene is revealed. 
                    <br />Claudio senses a powerful force in the Far East that is unconnected to either Jin or Kazuya.<br />
                    <br />The reporter researches the Mishima family history, learning that Heihachi's coup against his father Jinpachi and the death of his wife Kazumi both occurred in the same year he threw his son Kazuya off a ravine.
                    <br />Meanwhile, the United Nations intelligence group has located Jin, but he evades capture long enough to be rescued by his half-uncle Lars Alexandersson. 
                    <br />Lars takes Jin to recuperate at Violet Systems, where Jin's adoptive uncle Lee Chaolan has repaired Alisa Bosconovitch following her seemingly permanent shutdown in the previous game. The Zaibatsu attacks the compound, but the trio are able to secure Jin. The reporter, having rendezvoused with Lee and Lars, tries to kill Jin in his sleep, but is discouraged by Lars, who says Jin is the only person capable of stopping the conflict.
                    <br />According to Lee, the reason behind Heihachi fathering Lars was to confirm that he didn’t possess the Devil Gene, proving it originated from the Hachijos, Kazumi's family.<br />
                    <br /> The force sensed by Claudio is eventually revealed to be Akuma, who made a promise to Kazumi that he would kill Heihachi and Kazuya if she fails to, as she predicted both of them would engulf the world in war and destruction.
                    <br />He defeats Heihachi after their temporary alliance on fending off an attack by an army of Jack-6's at the Mishima Dojo, and proceeds to G Corporation's Millennium Tower. 
                    <br />Heihachi survives, but declares himself dead to the public to continue his plans in secret. He then captures and spreads images of a transformed Kazuya worldwide before using an orbital laser weapon to obliterate Millennium Tower.
                    <br />Kazuya survives the attack and destroys the satellite, with the wreckage destroying a town and once again slandering the Zaibatsu.
                    <br />The reporter uses this opportunity to inform the Zaibatsu about his exposé, but to his surprise, Heihachi offers to meet him in person.
                    <br />Heihachi recounts his love of Kazumi and the night he learned that she possessed the Devil Gene and was sent by her family to kill him, regretfully being forced to kill her in self-defense, which eventually marked the feud amongst the Mishima clansmen as of the present. 
                    <br />Suspecting that Kazuya had inherited the Devil Gene, Heihachi threw him off a cliff, believing the boy's survival would confirm his fears. 
                    <br />Heihachi has the reporter escorted out back to Lars before traveling to a volcano for a final battle with Kazuya.
                    <br />Vengeful over his parents' betrayals, with Heihachi being the one who never told him about Kazumi's assassinations on them before her death in the first place, Kazuya finally kills Heihachi in battle and throws his body into the volcano. Moments later, Akuma appears and attacks Kazuya; the result of their battle is unknown.<br />
                    <br />In the aftermath, Jin awakes and meet up with Lee, Lars, and Alisa, promising to put an end to the war once and for all by killing Kazuya. The reporter, reflecting on all he has learned, completes and publishes his exposé.

                <h3>Development</h3>
                In January 2014, Tekken series director and producer Katsuhiro Harada expressed interest in continuing the series on PlayStation 4,[24] and later said that PlayStation was the primary platform of development for the new installment.[25] Tekken 7 was announced by Harada on July 13, 2014 during EVO 2014.[26] The announcement was not initially planned, but was done as a last minute response to a leak of the game's announcement trailer that morning.[27] The game was developed using the Unreal Engine 4, which allows for it to be developed for multiple platforms.[28][29] While Tekken games historically have been PlayStation-based in arcades, Harada stated that Tekken 7 runs on an arcade board based on PC architecture.[30]<br /><br />

                Location tests of the game were held in Tokyo and Osaka from October 3 to 5, 2014.[31] Trailers released in late 2014 showed the game running in 1080p and 60 frames per second.[32] On January 27, 2015, a live-televised tournament based on the same game build was held in the Nexon Arena in Seoul, South Korea known as "Tekken 7 Crash".[33] During the Japan Amusement Expo (JAEPO) 2015, a newer build of the game was showcased, offering Lucky Chloe and Shaheen as part of the character roster for the first time as well as the traditional stage-based gameplay progression.[34]<br /><br />

                Negative reactions to the character Lucky Chloe from several message boards has led to Harada tweeting that he may consider removing her from the North American version of the game, making her exclusive to the East Asian and European versions, and instead replace her with a new well-muscled skinhead for the North American market. It was later revealed that Harada did not intend for the tweets to be taken seriously.[35] Although reaction to the revelation of new character Shaheen was largely positive,[36][37] the reveal eventually led to Harada making a statement on his Twitter in response to those criticizing the inclusion of an Arab character in the game.[38]<br /><br />

                While the announcement and reveal of the Filipina Josie Rizal character was also met with mostly positive feedback,[39][40] her revelation was also met with a mix of excitement[41] and derision among Filipino netizens.[42] Among the criticisms around the net were the lack of respect towards the martyred Philippine national hero José Rizal, as well as misrepresentation of Filipino Martial Arts.[43] According to Tekken chief producer Katsuhiro Harada, Mad Catz community manager Mark Julio,[44] and Josie's character designer Mari Shimazaki,[45] Josie Rizal practiced kickboxing and Eskrima, but the move set in her reveal video consisted of mostly generic and recycled moves from earlier existing characters in the Tekken series. Someone claiming to be an official of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts was not quite happy with the way the character of Josie was depicted and stated that they would try to look at steps to remedy how she might affect the image of José Rizal and the Philippines[46] by possibly submitting additional materials for the Tekken Team to use.[47] However, NCCA legal counsel Trixie Cruz-Angeles clarified that the agency had yet to issue any position on the matter in a post she made on her personal Facebook page: "The NCCA has not asked for the deletion of Tekken character Josie Rizal. In fact, the NCCA has not taken cognizance of the issue nor issued an opinion."[48]<br /><br />

                In July 2015, Bandai-Namco announced a crossover with The Idolmaster, a property owned by the company, involving Idolmaster costumes for the female characters of Tekken 7.[49] The male characters, meanwhile, are given the option to fight barechested.[50] A Bandai Namco-sponsored tournament, "The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2015, took place in November–December 2015 as well, with a prize of ¥10,000,000 (~$81,000) awarded to the finalists.[51] Two top placers from EVO 2015 were also reserved seats, as were select players from South Korea, North America, and other places.[51]<br /><br />


                On March 29, 2018, Bandai Namco announced that the online Tekken-Net service for the original arcade version of Tekken 7 would cease on May 31, 2018 in all regions, effectively ending support for the game. An update patch was issued which allowed the game to run offline.[52]

                <br /><br />
                <h5>Fated Retribution</h5>
                An arcade update title in the same vein as Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited and Tekken 6 Bloodline Rebellion, titled Tekken 7: Fated Retribution was announced in a trailer released during the grand final of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2015 tournament, which was held on December 12, 2015, and was released in Japan on July 5, 2016. The location test was held on February 12–14, 2016 in three arcades of Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka.[53] Several gameplay mechanics were introduced in the game, including Rage Drive and an adjusted Rage Art. It features an expanded content, including new customization and stages. Returning characters who have not received newer default costumes are accorded one. Additionally, new characters are featured, including the series' second guest character: Akuma from the Street Fighter series, who has a dedicated EX meter designed to limit some of his special moves. The console and PC versions were based on this update.[1][54]<br /><br />

                After The Idolmaster series, a collaboration with another Bandai Namco property, this time the Taiko no Tatsujin rhythm game series on August 31, 2016 added player icons, customization, and other aesthetic features.[55]<br /><br />

                A collaboration with New Japan Pro-Wrestling was announced during the "an presents Dai Pro-Wres Matsuri 2017" event on January 2, 2017. An attire inspired by IWGP Heavyweight champion Kazuchika "Rainmaker" Okada was added as an outfit for King. A new Rage Art for King inspired by Rainmaker would accompany the outfit. Additionally, NJPW-themed T-shirts were added for other characters. The event ran from January 23 to February 22, 2017.[56] Another collaboration with NJPW started on November 18, 2017, this time providing a Hiroshi Tanahashi-inspired outfit for Lars accompanied by a new Rage Art and background theme.[57]<br /><br />

                A collaboration with Summer Lesson, Bandai Namco's foray into PlayStation VR debuted on April 4, 2018. All female characters received costumes modeled after either of the game's three protagonists: Hikari Miyamoto, Allison Snow, and Chisato Shinjo.[58]<br /><br />

                Characters then exclusive for the console version: Eddy Gordo, Eliza, Kuma, Lee Chaolan, Miguel Caballero Rojo, and Panda, were announced on July 12, 2017 to be added for arcades on July 27, 2017.[59] Three out of ten stages added in the console version: G Corp. Helipad, Infinite Azure, and Violet Systems were added for arcades as part of the Ver.Q update on November 14, 2017.[60] The rest were added as part of the Ver.T update on April 3, 2018.[61]<br /><br />

                An update titled Tekken 7: Fated Retribution Round 2 was announced at the "Tekken Mastercup.10" event on October 20, 2018 and released for arcades on February 13, 2019.[62] The update brought all content from the console version yet to be added to the arcades at that time, including six characters (Anna Williams, Armor King, Craig Marduk, Geese Howard, Lei Wulong, and Noctis Lucis Caelum) and two stages (Hammerhead and Howard Estate).[63] An upcoming May 2019 update, announced during a March 24, 2019 livestream, will add the character Julia Chang.[64]<br /><br />

                <h5>Home versions</h5>
                The PlayStation 4 version was confirmed at Paris Games Week 2015 on October 27, 2015. Bandai Namco also announced that the PlayStation 4 version would feature exclusive content, as well as PlayStation VR support.[65] In addition to previous graphical upgrades in the arcade version, the console versions also received one.[66] Exclusive content on the PlayStation 4 version were released in the form of classic costumes for Jin, Xiaoyu and King, as well as a Tekken jukebox with classic musical tracks.[67]<br /><br />

                At E3 2016, Tekken 7 was announced to be released for the Xbox One and Windows platforms in 2017, in addition to the PlayStation 4 version.[68] An official trailer, revealed during same event, showcased some of new features that were included in Fated Retribution, such as graphical updates and stages, as well as a story mode, which adds cutscenes and dialogue during battles.[69]
                <br /><br />
                The game is supported by downloadable content. Players who pre-ordered the game received a code that downloads the character Eliza.
