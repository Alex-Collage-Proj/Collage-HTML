                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    One-Punch Man began publication in 2009 when One became interested in creating a comic super hero that was already the strongest in the world.[16] One had wanted to focus on different aspects of storytelling than standard super hero stories normally rely on, such as every day problems. One said, "Punching is oftentimes pretty useless against life's problems. But inside One Punch Man's universe, I made Saitama a sort of guy who was capable of adapting his life to the world that surrounded him, only armed with his immense power. The only obstacles he faces are mundane things, like running short of money."[16] One self published the series on the website Nitosha, a Japanese site for publishing online manga.<br /><br />

                    The series was an instant success online, where One generated thousands of viewers and comments within weeks.[17] According to One, the series really began to take off by the time he had written the fifth chapter.[18] On Nitosha, a series was considered popular if it consistently received at least 30 comments, but by the time One had published chapter 30, he was receiving nearly a thousand comments per chapter.[18] In February 2010, One put the series on hiatus in order to focus on work for his family.[19]<br /><br />

                    When One returned to drawing manga in 2011, he was contacted by Yusuke Murata about a possible partnership, where Murata would redraw the manga for One. Murata had been an enormous fan of One-Punch Man, and was ill at the time.[20] Fearing that he was going to die, he contacted One. Reflecting back he said, "Around that time, I was actually really sick. I broke out in hives, my inner organs were infected, and I couldn't breathe well with my windpipes swelling. I was in the hospital when I thought, "Ah, I guess people die just like that." If I'm going to die, I want to do something I really love to do. I want to draw manga with Mr. ONE. That's what I thought."[20]<br /><br />

                    Murata, an already successful manga artist, used his connections in the industry to get a publishing deal with Weekly Young Jump comics.<br /><br />

                <h3>Theme</h3>
                <p>
                    On an unnamed Earth-like super-continent planet, powerful monsters and villains have been mysteriously appearing and causing disasters. To combat them, the world's government created a Hero Association that employs superheroes to stop the violent creatures and villains. Each of the Hero Association's superheroes are ranked from Class-C to Class-S. Saitama is an unranked hero, hailing from the metropolis of City-Z, who performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself to the point where he can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch. However, since Saitama became a hero for the fun of the experience, he has lately become bored with his superhuman power, and frustrated at the complete lack of strong opponents that can challenge him. It is confirmed Saitama (the protagonist) could destroy a solar system if he used a super-serious punch at full power.<br /><br />

                    Over the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, friends, villains, and monsters. He quickly gains a pupil, the cyborg Genos, who is on a revenge quest to find another cyborg that slaughtered his entire family and hometown. Eventually the two join the Hero Association in order to gain official recognition. Genos proves to be a prodigy and is instantly placed in Class-S, while Saitama barely passes the written test and is therefore placed in Class-C, making him the lowest ranked hero. Saitama performs many feats that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public, such as defeating the ninja Speed of Sound Sonic and destroying an incoming meteor that was going to obliterate City-Z. Saitama is promoted to Class-B after he defeats the powerful Deep Sea King, who rains destruction on City-J. Monsters begin to appear in City-Z, searching for a mysterious Monster Association. Soon after, the great seer Shibabawa has a vision that the world is in danger. Panicking, the Hero Association calls all S-Class heroes to a meeting, begging them to protect the world. Immediately after the meeting, the leader of the Dark Matter Thieves, Boros, invades the planet and destroys City-A. Saitama duels with Boros and defeats him by using a serious punch. During the invasion of aliens, the S-Class hero, Drive Knight, warns Genos that the S-Class hero, Metal Knight, is his enemy. The Hero Association salvages City-A with the help of Metal Knight, and they build a new base of operations that will allow the Hero Association to deploy heroes more easily.<br /><br />

                    Saitama begins to gradually know other superheroes. He quickly becomes friends with the old martial arts master, Bang, and the "most powerful" superhero named, King, who is actually a cowardly nonviolent otaku who got his S-Class position by accidentally receiving credit for many of Saitama's previous victories. When the Hero Association executive Sitch tries to recruit villains to become superheroes, Bang's former apprentice, Garo, emerges and starts beating down many of the other heroes, prompting the association to make a small effort to stop him.<br /><br />

                    In order to learn more about martial arts, Saitama enters a tournament in disguise. During the martial arts tournament, the Monster Association leads an all-out attack on multiple cities causing massive panic and damage. The Hero Association struggles to keep up with the attacks. Genos fights monsters and protects the tournament so that Saitama can safely compete. Despite being the most powerful hero in the world, Saitama automatically loses the tournament due to being caught wearing a wig and impersonating another martial artist, Charanko. Saitama flees the tournament in fear of being arrested by the police. During the award ceremony, the powerful monster, Gouketsu, lays siege on the tournament after defeating Genos in combat. Gouketsu presents monster cells that can turn humans into monsters after being ingested to the people of the stadium, telling them that he'll kill them if they don't ingest the cells. Some people partake of the cells becoming monsters, including the martial artist, Bakuzan. Saitama returns to the stadium after hearing explosions and the winner of the tournament, Suiryu's desperate cries for help. Saitama defeats Gouketsu and Bakuzan before they can slaughter innocent people. Saitama humbles Suiryu and inspires the cocky martial artist to become a hero.<br /><br />

                    The B-Class hero, Fubuki, tries to have Saitama join her faction of heroes. Garo, determined to become the most powerful monster, continues to grow stronger and stronger and hunts more heroes down including S-Class heroes, Tank-Top Master and Metal Bat. The Hero Association ranks him at a threat of "Dragon" level, the second highest that is possible. They fail to capture him after sending a team of A-Class heroes to stop him. Bang confronts Garo and almost kills him, but the Monster Association rescues him at the last second to try and recruit him. The Monsters continue to attack people and continue to gather in City-Z, being led by the powerful psychic, Gyoro Gyoro, and the monster king, Orochi. Garo refuses to join the Monster Association and continues to defeat heroes. Meanwhile, the Hero Association leads an all out war against the Monster Association with hundreds of heroes, after the monsters kidnap the child of a high ranking contributor to the Hero Association. A new association known as, The Organization, consisting of powerful robots, allies itself with the Monster Association by sending robots such as G5 to help in the war.<br /><br />
